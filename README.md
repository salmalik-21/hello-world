My first repository on GitHub

Its me Salman. Perhaps you don't know me. Understandable. Well, see, I don't want to burden you with all the details about myself, just know I come in peace and I am not here to take over the world. That's all you need to know. Don't stress yourself though. We'll be good friends. If you also have such plans of world domination'nt. I swear this is how them computer nerds talk. Thinking they're quirky and witty. Nah you're just lame. ;)
